                How do I disable the teleportation or event when a player is flagged?

                The configuration option cancelEventIfHacking controls teleportation and events
                ----------------
                How do I know what each configuration is exceeded in-game?
                
                There is a configuration option called "debugMode" it will say what config option the player has exceeded in-game
                ----------------
                How do I unban a player?
                
                The command /sacunban (player)
                ----------------
                The anti-cheat isn't working?
                
                Either the player is in creative mode, the player has the permission sac.bypass or you are using a version that is 1.16 or below
                ----------------
                The player wasn't cheating and got flagged?
                
                Report to Korbsti immediately as it is most likely a false flag and a bug within the anti-cheat itself
                ----------------
                How do I turn up the violation count before a kick occurs?
                
                The configuration option violationKickNumUntilKick
                ----------------
                How do I enable spaced violation messages?
                
                The configuration option spacedViolationMessages has to be set to true
                ----------------
                Is there a way to disable the entire anti cheat just in case of emergency?
                
                yep, type /sacadmin
                ---------------
                Is there a way to change config options in game?
                
                Yes! The command /sacadmin
                ---------------
                Why is the jar file obfuscated?
                
                To prevent the checks from being easily bypassed, and optimization purposes
                ---------------
                 
                ---------------
                Why is that sometimes a player is flagged for fluidWalk on join or hitting when they are on land?
                
                This player has criticals enabled and the anti-cheat detected that
                ---------------
                Are there any skidded checks?
                
                None, I refuse to use skidded checks in SoaromaSAC
                -----------
                What do you use to make the jar file have lots of random letters when decompiling?
                
                ProGuard
                -----------
                How do I make this compatible with mcMMO?
                
                Set the following variables to:
                reachBlockBreakNum: 200
                checkAutoClicker: false or CPSUntilHacking: 30
                -----------
                Is this compatible with plugins that make you double jump or go really fast without speed effect or so?
                
                It is possible however many configurations will have to be changed resulting in an insensitive anti-cheat
                -----------
                Does SoaromaSAC use a player event or packets for movement checks?
                
                SoaromaSAC uses PacketPlayInFlying and PacketPlayInVehicleMove for movement checks, everything else uses events
                -----------
                A check is falsing?
                
                Each check usually goes by [check][type], example speedA, or speedB, Semi Prediction B etc
                
                You can go into main.yml and go to the specific section if where [check] is and there is usually a ending letter on each key which is [type]
                
                Extra* The [check] is what is inside cheat-names inside main.yml, you'll see a giant list of cheat check names, always type in lower caps when typing the permission in-game
                
                You can make that more insensitive or disable it
